boilerplate
=====================================
As a programmer, we usually tend to get into situations where in we have to write the same functionality or use the same functionality time and again. 

Usually, it takes a while re-using the functionality or re-writing the same functionality based on different projects we work on. And often, it is booring to rewrite it again or start from the scratch.

This repo is an initiative to come up with some boilerplate code which we tend to use more or often in our programming life.
